# Vue 3 Cross Platform Starter Kit
Welcome to the Vue 3 Cross Platform Starter Kit! This kit provides a solid starting point for developing cross platform apps for **Web**, **IOS**, and **Android** using web technologies. The kit includes the following technologies:

- Vue 3: A popular and progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Capacitor: A cross-platform app runtime that enables web apps to run natively on multiple platforms.
- Tailwindcss: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style your app with pre-defined classes.
- Pinia: A state management library for Vue that provides a simple and flexible way to manage your app's state.
- TypeScript: A statically typed language that builds on JavaScript and adds features such as type - annotations, interfaces, and classes.
- Vite: A fast and efficient build tool for modern web development that can significantly speed up your development workflow.

## Getting Started
To get started with this starter kit, you will need to have Node.js and npm (or any other node related package manager of your choice) installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/vue3-cross-platform-starter-kit.git
cd vue3-cross-platform-starter-kit
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000 where you can view and test your app in the browser. To build the app for production, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile and optimize your app for deployment to a web server or to a native app store.
